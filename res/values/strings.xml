    <string name="help_contents">GV is an Android interface for the Google Voice service. Note that this application is highly dependent on the
    Google Voice team not changing their mobile HTTP interface anytime soon, and will almost certainly break this application if they do.\n
    I highly recommend that if you enjoy this application, write the Google Voice team to request an official version, or at least a
    supported API.</string>
